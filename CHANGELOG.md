## 🎨 Dataset Design Philosophy

### Batch Organization Strategy
Each batch targets specific support dimensions:

1. **Core** (batch_00) - Foundation scenarios
2. **Technical** (batch_01) - Software/system issues
3. **Billing** (batch_02) - Financial/account concerns
4. **Escalation** (batch_03) - High-priority cases
5. **Difficult Customers** (batch_04) - De-escalation scenarios
6. **Integration** (batch_05) - API/developer support
7. **Security** (batch_06) - Compliance/data protection
8. **Onboarding** (batch_07) - New user guidance
9. **Product** (batch_08) - Bug reports/feature requests
10. **Performance** (batch_09) - Speed/optimization issues
11. **Mixed** (batch_10) - Multi-dimensional complexity

### Quality Standards
- ✅ Realistic customer scenarios
- ✅ Diverse difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard)
- ✅ Expert-validated responses
- ✅ Balanced escalation coverage
- ✅ Varied customer personas

⬜ Sales Engineer     - Technical pre-sales scenarios
⬜ DevOps Engineer    - Infrastructure/deployment support
⬜ Product Manager    - Feature prioritization decisions
⬜ Security Analyst   - Threat assessment scenarios
```

## 📝 Notes & Learnings

### Moonshot Integration Requirements
- Recipe IDs must match exact paths for cookbook references
- Datasets require proper `input_field` and `reference_field` mapping
- API validation checks for required schema fields
- Dataset consolidation improves UI performance

### Batch Creation Best Practices
- 100 prompts per batch = good balance for testing
- Mix difficulty levels: 25 easy, 50 medium, 25 hard
- Include expected responses with escalation flags
- Professional tone essential for enterprise scenarios

### Vibe Coding Tips
- Commit after each batch completion
- Keep README updated in dataset directories
- Use descriptive commit messages for easy tracking
- Feature branches for multi-batch work
